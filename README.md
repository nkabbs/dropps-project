1) If you don't have Node.js installed, go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download and install the most current version available.
2) Download the zip file from git, and unzip it into any folder you want.
3) Open up the newly created folder in the terminal/command prompt, and enter the command "npm start" (no quotes). This should pull up an instance of the app on your browser.
